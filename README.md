# trader-shell-go

This is an example of a simple order and execution management system (OEMS) built for Coinbase Prime for trading over FIX, order tracking and management over REST, and order book management over WebSocket. This tool has several built-in functionalities:

1. Market and limit order placement
2. Order Preview with calculated slippage and commission
3. Fat finger protection for both total notional order size and overly marketable limit orders
4. One Cancels the Other (OCO) orders with logic that emulates a stop loss order
5. A maintained, customizable order book for any product supported by Prime
6. Open order management and cancellation
7. Closed order tracking
8. Account balances at the asset level
9. OCO order management

## Configuring this application

1. Begin by cloning this repository and changing directories with the following commands:
f
```
git clone https://github.com/coinbase-samples/trader-shell-go
cd trader-shell-go
```
2. Ensure all dependencies are available with the following command:
```
go mod tidy
```
3. You will need to populate your Coinbase Prime credentials into creds_ex.json and config_ex.yaml. Specifically, you will need to provide your SVC_ACCOUNTID on line 24 of config_ex.yaml, as well as your API credentials and Portfolio ID to creds_ex.json. Afterwards, rename creds_ex.json to creds.json and config_ex.yaml to config.yaml
4. For FIX to operate, you will need a valid certificate, which you may import directly if you are familiar, or by running this to generate a new certificate:
```
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect fix.prime.coinbase.com:4198 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -outform PEM > fix-prime.coinbase.com.pem
```
5. To run the application, type the following command:
```
go run . config.yaml
```
## Using this application:
Upon running the application, you should immediately see an OnCreate message and then an `S >>` to admin, followed by a `R <<` response back from the admin saying you are connected to Coinbase Prime over FIX. The most logical scenario in which this step fails is that either the certificate was not properly built, so please make sure you have properly completed step 5.

After successfully getting a response back from the server, you should see a large ASCII art welcoming you to the application, followed by a menu with the following choices:
```
1. trade input
2. market data
3. order manager
4. oco manager
```
Type a number and hit enter to make a choice.

1. Trade input is where you can place trades over FIX, or generate an order preview over REST. The format for submitting orders is as follows:

`product orderType buyOrSell conditionalLimitPrice baseQuantity optionalFlags`
Examples of common orders are shown below:
```
eth-usd mkt b 0.001
eth-usd lim b 1400 0.001
ltc-usd lim s 100 15 -p
btc-usd lim b 15000 0.001 -oco 30000
```

These orders translate to the following:

1. I wish to market buy 0.001 ETH on the ETH-USD market
2. I wish to limit buy 0.001 ETH at $1400 on the ETH-USD market
3. I wish to preview a limit sell order for 15 LTC at $100
4. I wish to place an OCO order for BTC on the BTC-USD market where my underlying limit price is $15000 and my upper trigger stop buy is $30000.

- The `-p` flag allows you to preview the order (over REST) and then you can hit `g` to submit it
- The `-oco` flag is a complex order type where you create a limit with a stop loss (second value) â€” the stop loss value is recorded and stored in main menu option 4. If either 1500 or 2000 are hit, the other order is cancelled. In order for OCO mode to properly function, make sure that the product you are interested in is included in the supportedProducts variable within create.go.
- Fat finger protection will prevent you from placing a market order that costs over a certain notional limit, or a limit order that is more than 5% over the current market price. Like OCO orders, this functionality requires including additional products to the supportedProducts variable within create.go, as well as adjusting MaxOrderSize, also within create.go.


2. Market data will allow you to subscribe to any available Coinbase Prime product and visualize its order book up to 9 levels deep, e.g.:
```
eth-usd 5
```
This screen will also present your available balance so that you may quickly exit and place a trade with the relevant trade information that this screen provides.

3. Order manager provides insight into open, closed, and balance data. You are able to cancel open orders directly from the open orders screen by naming an order by number and including `-c`, i.e. `1 -c`
4. OCO manager provides visual data for currently open OCO orders. You may cancel an OCO order directly from this screen by naming an order by number and including `-c`, i.e. `1 -c`
